# Beyond API

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "beyond_api"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Next, you need to run the generator:

```bash
$ rails generate beyond_api:install
```

This will generate the configuration file on `config/initializers/beyond_api.rb`. Set the `client_id` and `client_secret` values to get started.

> ⚠️ **Be careful!** Don't expose your `client_id` and `client_secret` or publish them on GitHub or any other service. Use [Rails Credentials](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials) or a gem like [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to save your environment variables.

To install the gem manually from your shell, run:

```bash
$ gem install beyond_api
```
